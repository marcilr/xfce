================================
Disabling LightDM/Xfce did the trick.  Now the 
XScreenSaver 5.42 works great.

Lock with:   Ctrl+Alt+L
Unlock:      tap key and enter workstation login

"I think you can simply disable and change the default
screensaver locker anyway.  Firstly disable light-locker 
at [LightDM/Xfce] Power Management Preferences followed by:

$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install xscreensaver && sudo apt-get remove light-locker

then after reboot (restart X) I got the xscreensaver as 
default screen locker manager."
