The default xfce-screen lock is:
    ctrl-alt-l

However, unable to unlock screen short of system reboot.

================================
"I think you can simply disable and change the default
screensaver locker anyway.  Firstly disable light-locker 
at [LightDM/Xfce] Power Management Preferences followed by:

$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install xscreensaver && sudo apt-get remove light-locker

then after reboot (restart X) I got the xscreensaver as 
default screen locker manager."
