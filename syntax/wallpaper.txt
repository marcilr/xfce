Wallpaper


In Xfce to configure wallpaper run:
  xfce4-settings-manager

Despire there being alot by default under:
  /usr/share/wallpaper

I created:
  /usr/local/wallpaper

Ran xfce4-settings-manager as rmarcil and under 'Desktop'
reconfigured the "Folder" from 'desktop-base'.

From googling looks like the wallpapers folder is:
  /usr/share/backgrounds/xfce/

To pick image go to:
  Applications > Settings > Desktop

This was useful in setting wallpaper:
  Solution
  1) Run thunar
  2) Go to the folder /usr/share/xfce4
  3) Click once over the folder /backdrops    (this folder will contain all the images you want for your dektop)
  4) Drag the folder to the left to include it in your preferred folders
  5) Run xfdesktop-settings
  6) Choose the folder backdrops, that now will appear in your list and will be accessible
  7) The images will be diplayed
  8) Chose a nice image
  9) Enjoy
  --[SOLVED] I can't choose desktop background under User.

  In thunar set wallpaper folder to:
    /usr/share/backgrounds/xfce/

  Think in xfdesktop-settings can select an image for wallpaper.

=============================
To get the single wallpaper image I had set to span the screens:
  right-click Desktop > Desktop Settings... > Background
  select: Style: Spanning screens
  click Close

Noticed "Folder" is set to "wallpaper", think /usr/local/wallpaper?

This fixed my ~/bin/wallpaper script.
