Wallpaper for XFCE


XFCE wallpaper directory:
  /usr/share/backgrounds/xfce/
    xfce-blue.jpg
      Mouse on blue background

    xfce-teal.jpg
      Mouse on zoned blue background

=============================
To get the single wallpaper image I had set to span the screens:
  right-click Desktop > Desktop Settings... > Background
  select: Style: Spanning screens
  click Close

Noticed "Folder" is set to "wallpaper", think /usr/local/wallpaper?

This fixed my ~/bin/wallpaper script.
