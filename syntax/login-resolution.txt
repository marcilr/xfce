Login resolution


To update the grub text or login update GRUB_GFXMODE in 
/etc/default/grub as follows:

#
# The resolution used on graphical terminal
# note that you can use only modes which your graphic card supports via VBE
# you can see them in real GRUB with the command `vbeinfo'
#
# NOTE: Uncertain this actual works.
#
#GRUB_GFXMODE=640x480
GRUB_GFXMODE=1920x1080

Remember to run update-grub afterwards to update
/boot/grub/grub.cfg

# update-grub
