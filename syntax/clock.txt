XFCE Panel Clock Disappears
===========================
Right click the clock panel (or access from panel preferences)
and set the configuration you want but do NOT close the properties
window.  Instead, while leaving it open, logout and log back in.
The clock should reappear with the preferences you set.  For some
reason closing the properties window seems to reset the settings
to blank custom fields, which makes the clock disappear.
