Xfce Desktop Environment


Xfce is a lightweight desktop environment for UNIX-like operating systems.
It aims to be fast and low on system resources, while still being visually
appealing and user friendly.

"Like GNOME, Xfce is based on the GTK toolkit, but it is not a GNOME fork.
It uses the Xfwm window manager, described below. Its configuration is
entirely mouse-driven, with the configuration files hidden from the casual
user.[6] Xfce does not feature any desktop animations, but Xfwm supports
compositing.[7]"
